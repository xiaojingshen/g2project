User can select different graph by using the dropdown list on the top.\r\n\r\n1.1 Popular Locations Barchart\r\nUser can select different date by using the Date dropdown list to view the bar chart for number of transactions in different locations and date. The order of location is sorted decreasingly to provide a more straightforward intuition about which locations are more popular.\r\n\r\n1.2 Popular Locations Heatmap\r\nThis graph displays the heat map for different locations to show the distribution of sales in different hours of day to detect the peak hours. User can select different date by using the Date dropdown list. When hover a specific rectangle in this graph, it will show the location name, hour and the corresponding number of transactions in this hour.\r\n\r\nThe overall 14-days sales bar chart is also displayed in this page to provide an overview for the most popular locations in these 14 days.\r\n\r\n1.3 Location Sales Boxplot\r\nThis graph is used to show the distribution of sales in a specific location during these 14 days to detect suspicious outliers. User can use the Location dropdown list to select the box plot for different locations. When hover on a specific point in this plot, it will show the day, price and corresponding credit card or loyalty card number for the selected transaction.\r\n\r\n2 GPS Record\r\nThis tab is used for visualization of timeline and maps using gps record data. User can select different graph by using the dropdown list on the top.\r\n\r\n2.1 GPS Record Timeline\r\nThis graph can be used to detect those driving record at suspicious time and provide an overview of the daily driving time period for different car id. User can use the Day dropdown list to select different days. When hover a specific point in this graph, it will show the corresponding card id and timestamp for this record.\r\n\r\n2.2 GPS Record Path (Time Period)\r\nThis map can show the driving path in a selected timeslot. User can use the Car ID and Day dropdown list to choose different car and day. The Start Hour and End Hour is used to set the timeslot. For example, if user want to view driving path between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., then the start hour should be set at 7 and the end hour should be set at 13.\r\n\r\n2.3 GPS Record Path (Timestamp)\r\nThis map shows the driving path in a short timeslot to detect the possible card owner and car id relationship. User can select different days by the Day dropdown list. The Hour and Minute dropdown list is used for setting the timestamp user would like to detect. For example, if user want to view the exact location of each car in Jan 6 8:00 a.m., then the hour should be set at 8 and minute should be set at 0. In this scenario, the map will show the related driving path between 8:00 and 8:03. The 3 minutes time window is set to better incorporate all those related gps records.\r\n\r\nThe data table for credit card data is also shown in this page to provide user some convenience if they want to refer to the data table and select a specific timestamp.\r\n\r\n3 Total Data Match\r\nThis tab shows the data table for final result of matching card owner with corresponding car id and some other personal information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Those who do not have company cars have the ability to check out company trucks for business use, but these trucks cannot be used for personal business.\r\nEmployees with company cars are happy to have these vehicles, because the company cars are generally much higher quality than the cars they would be able to afford otherwise. However, GAStech does not trust their employees. Without the employees? knowledge, GAStech has installed geospatial tracking software in the company vehicles. The vehicles are tracked periodically as long as they are moving.\r\nThis vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.\r\nTo promote local businesses, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation. However, Kronos Kares does not collect personal information beyond purchases.\r\nAs a visual analytics expert assisting law enforcement, your mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. You must cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.\r\nUse visual analytics to analyze the available data and develop responses to the questions below. In addition, prepare a video that shows how you used visual analytics to solve this challenge. Submission instructions are available here. Entry forms are available for download below.\r\nTasks and Questions:\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.\r\nAdd the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find?

It is a growing discipline providing important analytics in a wide range of applications in different industries, such as government application in health, weather, electric utilizations providers to do tracking, optimize routines and schedules. A shiny application was developed following a data analytics workflow process of exploratory data analysis to allow user to uncover the hidden patterns in an effective way.\r\n1. Introduction\r\nThis project is to conduct the data visualization on the Vast-challenge 2021 mini-challenge 2 to give some insights on some abnormal activities. The background of this challenge is that some employees from company GAStech located in Abila is missing and we need to find out the abnormality by analysis the credit card purchase history data and gps tracking data. The analysis was mainly performed by exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and exploratory data analysis (EDA). We combined the geo-spatial data with aspatial attribute data and develop a shiny application to provide interactive analysis. The data sets given are the 2 weeks data before some employees’ missing date. Including employees’ credit card and loyalty card transaction records, gps records, and car assignment. The company cars which are approved for both personal and business use, and the vehicles are tracked periodically if they are moving. An assignment was done as a groundwork for an interactive Shiny app. The purpose of this assignment is to explore the packages that can be used and finding how interactivity can be added to the application to help the users in exploring the data. Then a shiny application has been built to provide an interactive analysis.\r\n2. Motivation of the application\r\nOur research and development efforts were motivated by the general lack of effective and easy to use web-enabled geospatial analytics tool for discovering patterns in the map with gps data. It aims to provide car movement track with a dedicated date and car ID on a specific time or a time period. By using the free application R-shiny to build a free open-source tool without requiring users to code or understand R.\r\nTo be able to create a map that can display gps tracks in specific date and time by different car ID.\r\nTo be able to plot a heatmap with information on frequency of attending by different date, time and location.\r\nTo be able to plot a car movement timestamp by different car ID over different date time.\r\n3. Review and Critic on past works\r\nThe same challenge was performed in 2014. Hence, we can get some clue of method has been used in our analysis. A background map of this town is necessary as we have the gps data on the map to view the track of the cars’ movement. Most of the analysis has applied the map as the background map, and applied the gps data with different car ID and timelines on the map. To plot out the map with gps point on the surface, we will use tmap packages in the following paragraphs to plot the gps data. tmap package designed to generate the thematic maps with great flexibility. The syntax for creating plots is like that of ggplot2, but tailored to maps. Another method which can be applied in our analysis is to plot a heat map timeline by transactions in different locations. This can help us to observe the pattern of normal activity in certain period also some abnormality activity can be observed. Heat maps allow us to simultaneously visualize clusters of samples and feature, where data values are transformed to color scale. The most basic heatmap we can build with R and ggplot2, using the geom_tile() function. Input data must be a long format where each row provides an observation. At least 3 variables are needed per observation: x as position on the X axis; y as position on the Y axis; fill with the numeric value that will be translated in a color.\r\n4. Design Framework\r\nThe application uses R-language, using standard R packages to plot the graph and using Shiny to webify the codes for simplicity and provides options or interactivity. Following packages has been applied: ‘shiny’, ‘ggplot2’, ‘readr’, ‘clock’,‘dplyr’, ‘plotly’, ‘tidyverse’,‘raster’, ‘sf’,‘tmap’ and ‘shinythemes’.\r\n4.1 Data Preparation\r\nThe following datasets are provided:\r\nGPS tracking data (Timestamp, Car ID, latitude, longitude)\r\nCredit card data for GASTech employees (timestamp, location, price, last 4 digits of credit card number)\r\nLoyalty card data for GASTech employees (timestamp, location, price, loyalty card number)\r\nCar assignment data which lists employee, their Car ID, and their position at GASTech\r\nGeospatial files for the city and country which provide context for the GPS data.\r\n4.2 User Interface Design\r\nOur structure of R shiny dashboard contains three parts: header, sidebar, and body, which allows interactive bivariate and correlation analysis to be performed under the exploratory data analysis. It consists of three major views namely: map, graphics and table, depicting different aspects of the data to the user.\r\nLocation\r\nPopular Locations- Barchart\r\nFor popular location exploration, the total number of transactions at different locations are displayed by a bar chart. Applying the day filter we can see top popular locations in specific days.\r\nPopular Locations- Heatmap\r\nA heatmap is used here to show the distribution of transactions in different days to detect the peak hour of different locations. We get the popular location names from the result of previous part and select the corresponding transaction data. \r\nLocation Sales- Boxplot\r\nFor popular location exploration, the total number of transactions at different locations are displayed by a bar chart.\r\n\r\nGPS Record\r\nGPS Record Timeline – Scatter plot\r\nSince we want to detect anomalies in these locations, we not only cares about their total sales but also want to know the amount of each order. A box plot is designed to show the distribution of price of each order. A new column day is added since we want to see that distribution in different days.\r\n\r\nGPS Record Path – Time Period\r\nGPS timeline can show different car ID appears in different timestamp, filter by day. so in this way we can clearly see which time period cars have activities the most and also observe the abnormal activities during suspicious time period such as 2am to 4am.\r\n\r\nGPS Record Path – Timestamp\r\nGPS record path plot can work for visualization of path for different car ID, we can filter car ID and specific day, start hour and end hour. In this way we can see who hangout frequently and what specific time period and location they pass by.\r\n\r\nTotal Data Match\r\nGPS Record timeline is not effective because we hardly see the points or GPS track in specific time, so we add one more graph for timestamp. In the table below we can clearly see the purchasing record which contains the time point, location, price and corresponding credit card last four number.\r\n\r\nFinally we use the data table to infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card, matched with car ID as well as employment type and title. The relationships between employees can clearly shown on the table too.\r\n5. Demonstration\r\n5.1 To investigate the most popular locations over different time period\r\n\r\nWhen plot the Calendar Heat map, we can see the high-density points are fall in 7 to 8 am, 12 to 1pm and 19 to 20 pm. 7 to 8 am in the morning, most people went to Brew’ve been served, followed by Hallowed Grounds, coffee cameleon, abila airport and kronos Mart. 12 to 1 pm in the noon, most people went to dinning venues to have lunch. But we still observed a few people went to Carlyle Chemical Inc., Stewart and Sons Fabrication Chostus Hotel, Desafio Golf Course, Nationwide Refinery, Ahaggo Museum.\r\nFrom dinner time 7 pm to 8 pm, most people went to dinning venues to have dinner.However, one people went to abila Zacharo, and two went to Roberts and Sons.\r\n5.2 To investigate the transaction amount over locations in last 14 days.\r\n\r\nAuto supply n’ More has one very strange transaction in Jan 13. The average order price is around 200 to 300 in this location, but we can see the price of this suspicious transaction reached 10000, which is nearly 50 times of the average amount. If this is not caused by operating error, then that may involve money laundering for those kidnappers.\r\nThe suspicious transaction we detected before is made by credit card 9551. After visualizing the locations this person frequently goes, we found one daily routine of this person is to stop off at Hallowed Grounds to grab some coffee before work. Since we don’t successfully match this credit card with its corresponding car owner, we can only match the daily activity pattern of this person with the gps path data and the car owner of car 8 (Lucas Alcazer) is the most likely one.\r\n5.3 To identify the potential relationship\r\n\r\nElsa Orilla (car id 7) and Brand Tempestad (car id 33) may be in a relationship. They show up at Chostus Hotel together multiple times (in Jan 8, 10, 14, 17). According to the gps data, we can see that both of them drive their own car and most of the time they don’t come from the same places, so it is more likely that they have an affair instead of being couples.\r\n5.4 Suspicious Activities\r\n\r\n Nils Calixto (car id 1), Loreto Bodrogi (car id 15), Isia Vann (car id 16) and Minke Mies (car id 24) drives in the late night in Jan 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, nearly every other day. Coincidentally, Loreto, Isia and Minke are all work at the security department.\r\n6. Discussion\r\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. The application uses the free and open-source R language that offering a thriving programming environment for statistical and graphical analysis. In this data visualization challenge, we played as visual analytics experts to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. We learned to cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.\r\n7. Future work\r\nRegarding to the social relationship between employees, it would be easier to identify if we can visualize who are in the same department. Given the data sources provided, we should also identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel if combined with timestamp because we can infer from their common activities during specific time periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\n2.0 Objectives\r\nThis project aims to analyze the movement and tracking data for GAStech company’s employees who are driving company cars for their personal and professional usage for the two weeks before their disappearance. With the GPS tracking data and credit card spending on each merchant, we can find out the abnormalities and suspicious behaviors, which will give us some insight into missing employees.\r\n3.0 Data Description\r\nThe following datasets are provided:\r\nGPS tracking data (Timestamp, Car ID, latitude, longitude)\r\nCredit card data for GASTech employees (timestamp, location, price, last 4 digits of credit card number)\r\nLoyalty card data for GASTech employees (timestamp, location, price, loyalty card number)\r\nCar assignment data which lists employee, their Car ID, and their position at GASTech\r\nGeospatial files for the city and country which provide context for the GPS data.\r\n4.0 Proposed approach\r\nIdentify popular location by transaction times\r\nUsing the credit and loyalty card data to identify the most popular locations, sorted by descending order.\r\nFigure out popular transaction date\r\nTry to figure out when these locations are popular and observe abnormal situations\r\nMovement track by date\r\nWith map plot with Gps data, we can observe the car movement for last 12 days , colored by different date.\r\nConsumption Amount Distribution for Each Location\r\nWe intend to visualize the consumption distribution of every location within one specific day, try to find a pattern and detect suspicious outliers.\r\nCredit Card Consumption Timeline\r\nWe aim to draw a consumption timeline for every location within one day to find the sequence of transactions in order to detect the informal relationship among card owners.\r\n\r\n5.0 Proposed R Packages\r\nPackage Name\r\nDescription\r\nShiny\r\nInteractive web applications for data visualization\r\nggplot2\r\ntidyverse data visualization package\r\nggmap\r\nVisualize the spatial information of static maps\r\nleaflet\r\nTo create maps within the application\r\ntmap\r\nFor static and interactive maps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
