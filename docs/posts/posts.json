In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\n2.0 Objectives\r\nThis project aims to analyze the movement and tracking data for GAStech companyâ€™s employees who are driving company cars for their personal and professional usage for the two weeks before their disappearance. With the GPS tracking data and credit card spending on each merchant, we can find out the abnormalities and suspicious behaviors, which will give us some insight into missing employees.\r\n3.0 Data Description\r\nThe following datasets are provided:\r\nGPS tracking data (Timestamp, Car ID, latitude, longitude)\r\nCredit card data for GASTech employees (timestamp, location, price, last 4 digits of credit card number)\r\nLoyalty card data for GASTech employees (timestamp, location, price, loyalty card number)\r\nCar assignment data which lists employee, their Car ID, and their position at GASTech\r\nGeospatial files for the city and country which provide context for the GPS data.\r\n4.0 Proposed approach\r\nIdentify popular location by transaction times\r\nUsing the credit and loyalty card data to identify the most popular locations, sorted by descending order.\r\nFigure out popular transaction date\r\nTry to figure out when these locations are popular and observe abnormal situations\r\nMovement track by date\r\nWith map plot with Gps data, we can observe the car movement for last 12 days , colored by different date.\r\nConsumption Amount Distribution for Each Location\r\nWe intend to visualize the consumption distribution of every location within one specific day, try to find a pattern and detect suspicious outliers.\r\nCredit Card Consumption Timeline\r\nWe aim to draw a consumption timeline for every location within one day to find the sequence of transactions in order to detect the informal relationship among card owners.\r\n\r\n5.0 Proposed R Packages\r\nPackage Name\r\nDescription\r\nShiny\r\nInteractive web applications for data visualization\r\nggplot2\r\ntidyverse data visualization package\r\nggmap\r\nVisualize the spatial information of static maps\r\nleaflet\r\nTo create maps within the application\r\ntmap\r\nFor static and interactive maps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
